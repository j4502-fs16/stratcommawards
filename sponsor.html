<h2> Our Sponsors </h2>
  <p> The 2017 Strategic Communication Awards is made possible by the following generous sponsors. </p>
</div>

<p id="letter"> Dear Potential Sponsor, </p>
<p id="letter"> We are writing today to make you aware of an annual event at the Missouri School of Journalism known as The Strategic Communication Awards Show. Each year, a team of students and an instructor collaborate to plan this event. This event showcases, recognizes and inspires creativity, talent and success of MU Strategic Communication students. This year, the University of Missouri’s student-run Strategic Communication Awards Show is asking for your support in honoring outstanding work.<p>
<p id="letter">Contributions will fund catering, decorations and awards for more than 150 individuals who will attend this celebration. With the help of generous contributions from businesses like yours, we will be able to expand upon our event, spread awareness, and improve the event’s credibility. Additionally, your sponsorship gives you an opportunity to become a top-of-mind employer among students who are actively seeking internships and careers in advertising.</p>
<p id="letter"> If you are interested in learning more about becoming a sponsor please contact Lauren Eiselben. Thank you for supporting our students and the 2017 Strategic Communication Awards! </p>
